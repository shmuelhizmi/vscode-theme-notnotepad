# NotNotePad ocean dark theme

this theme is base on the style of my project [NotNotePad](https://github.com/shmuelhizmi/notnotepad)
which is a browser based code editor you can view [here](https://notnotepad.now.sh)

this repo is a fork of akamud/vscode-theme-onedark but the theme is completely different.
